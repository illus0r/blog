Several months after creating my website, I decided that I needed some form of content management system, especially since I was planning on throwing my blog into the mix. Content was mixed with layout and the mobile version wasn’t great (it was a “m.dot” solution with different templates and content duplication — YIKES!).
I had been working with Symphony for a while with really nice results, so that was my first choice. It’s a PHP-based CMS with XSLT templates running on a MySQL database. It’s open-source, has a nice community with people writing plugins for pretty much everything and the back-end interface is clean and effective. However, after doing some tests I realised that it wouldn’t work for this case. Again, due to the very peculiar structure of this website, I had some exotic requirements.
